# Overview
## exchange-protocol
Noah Swap is an open source decentralized exchange that allows users to trade freely on the chain. It is a DeFi infrastructure open to everyone. As with most AMMs, trades between specific asset pairs are facilitated by holding reserves of both assets. It sets the transaction price between them based on the size of its reserves, and the price changes with the number of tokens in the pool. Any user is free to join or withdraw from the token liquidity pool, and becoming a liquidity provider or LP will bear part of the transaction risk in exchange for returns.
